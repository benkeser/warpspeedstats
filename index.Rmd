## What is primary hypothesis test?

Vaccine efficacy, $\text{VE}$, is the __percent reduction in relative risk__ comparing vaccine to placebo. 

$$
\text{VE} = 1 - \frac{\text{‚Äúrisk‚Äù in vaccine}}{\text{‚Äúrisk‚Äù in placebo}}
$$

* $\text{‚Äúrisk‚Äù}$ of what? See next slides.
* $\text{‚Äúrisk‚Äù}$ quantified by hazard, cumulative incidence, incidence rate, ...
  * in rare event setting, all similar

[FDA guidance](https://www.fda.gov/media/139638/download) (pg. 14) stipulates: 
* a point estimate of $\text{VE}$ for the primary endpoint of at
least 50% __and__ 
* lower bound of an appropriately adjusted confidence interval >30%.
* overall type I error control for one-sided test at 2.5%.

## What is the most relevant endpoint?

__SARS-CoV-2 infection__
* .blue2[+] relevant to stemming spread, many infections will be observed
* .red[-] clinically relevant? measured coarsely in time; many false positives

__COVID__
* .blue2[+] more clinically relevant, reasonable number of cases expected
* .red[-] clinically relevant if symptoms are mild?

__Severe COVID__
* .blue2[+] most clinically relevant, a-priori highest expected efficacy
* .red[-] very few cases expected to be observed, longer evaluation needed

---

## What is the most relevant endpoint?

__Burden of disease (BOD)__
* .blue2[+] more clinically relevant than COVID
* .blue2[+] lower power for .red[vaccines of questionable benefit]
* .blue2[+] power at least as high as COVID for .blue1[likely vaccine profiles]
* .red[-] best way to assign burden score? treating ordinal as continuous ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

## What is the most relevant endpoint?

[FDA guidance](https://www.fda.gov/media/139638/download) (pg. 13) states __either COVID or SARS-CoV-2 infection__ is an acceptable primary endpoint.
  *  OWS guidance to companies has been that __infection alone__ is __not acceptable__ as primary endpoint. 

<br> 

FDA guidance states companies, "should consider __powering efficacy trials__ for formal hypothesis testing on a __severe COVID endpoint__ [or] evaluate as a __secondary endpoint__."
  * Only Janssen so far is powering for severe COVID as primary.

.huge[Vaccine correlates]

---

## Correlates of risk/protection

Two, interrelated goals of correlates analysis are to 

* identify/validate possible __surrogate endpoints__;
* understand __protective mechanisms__ of vaccines. 

If an __immune correlate__ is established to __reliably predict vaccine efficacy__, then subsequent efficacy trials may use the CoP as the __primary endpoint__. 

__Accelerates approval__ of

* existing vaccines in __different populations__ (e.g., children);
* __new vaccines__ in the same class.

---

## Correlates of risk/protection

.large[__Two levels of correlates analysis__\*:]

__Correlates of risk:__

* Correlation of immune response in vaccine recipients with outcome
* Risk prediction
* Evaluates associative parameters

__Correlates of protection__

* Evaluate immune response's ability to predict vaccine efficacy
* Evaluates causal parameters

## Correlates of protection

__Effect modifiers of VE__

* How/does VE vary across subgroups defined by immune response?
* E.g., [Juraska et al (2020)](https://doi.org/10.1093/biostatistics/kxy074)


__Mediators of VE__

* What percentage of VE is attributable to immune response?
* E.g., [Cowling et al (2019)](https://doi.org/10.1093/cid/ciy759)


__Stochastic interventional VE__

* How/would shifting the immune response distribution impact VE?
* [Hejazi et al (2020)](https://doi.org/10.1111/biom.13375)

---

## Measuring correlates

Running assays on >30k samples is .red[expensive] and __statistically unnecessary__.

Instead we use a __case-cohort design__ ([Prentice, 1986](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2336266?seq=1)) to __measure immune responses__ in 
* a stratified random subcohort (\~1600 individuals)
* all SARS-CoV-2 endpoints

```{r, casecohortplot, echo = FALSE, out.height = "250px", fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/casecohort.png")
```

## Statistical challenges

__Estimation in two-phase designs__

* Individuals who contract COVID may __differ from other participants__.
* Two-phase design .red[over-samples] these individuals.
* Augmented/inverse weighting approaches to __account for differences__.

<br> 

__Low case numbers due to highly effective vaccines__

* Power for CoP analysis driven by __vaccine breakthroughs__.
* There were .red[only 11 breakthroughs] in Moderna!
* Need to be __judicious__ in which analyses are performed. 
* Ultimately, __establishment of correlate__ will need to additionally draw from __other sources of data__.

---

## Transparency and reproducibility

__CoVPN statisticians are committed to open science.__

An in-progress, version-controlled SAP is [available](https://figshare.com/articles/online_resource/CoVPN_COVID-19_Vaccine_Efficacy_Trial_Immune_Correlates_SAP/13198595) for review.

An __open-source R package__ is being developed to implement methods involved in the SAP. 

* Reproducible reports using R Markdown
* Vignettes including analysis of simulated data

Release of package and first correlates reports expected in __early 2021__.

---

## Concluding thoughts

Can we __trust__ the vaccine development process?

* Unequivocally, yes. Safety of vaccines is __aggressively monitored__. 

Efficacy results thus far are __overwhelmingly positive__.

* I am still in shock.

The story is not (close to) over. __There is still much to do and learn__!

* Community outreach/education to increase uptake
* Durability of vaccines
* Efficacy against infection/transmissibility
* Designs when placebo controls are not possible/ethical
* ...
