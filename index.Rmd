## What is primary hypothesis test?

Vaccine efficacy, $\text{VE}$, is the __percent reduction in relative risk__ comparing vaccine to placebo. 

$$
\text{VE} = 1 - \frac{\text{‚Äúrisk‚Äù in vaccine}}{\text{‚Äúrisk‚Äù in placebo}}
$$

* $\text{‚Äúrisk‚Äù}$ of what? See next slides.
* $\text{‚Äúrisk‚Äù}$ quantified by hazard, cumulative incidence, incidence rate, ...
  * in rare event setting, all similar

[FDA guidance](https://www.fda.gov/media/139638/download) (pg. 14) stipulates: 
* a point estimate of $\text{VE}$ for the primary endpoint of at
least 50% __and__ 
* lower bound of an appropriately adjusted confidence interval >30%.
* overall type I error control for one-sided test at 2.5%. 

---

## How is $\text{VE}$ estimated/tested?

|__Company__ | __Estimation approach__                     |
|:-----------|:--------------------------------------------|
|Pfizer      |Bayesian beta-binomial                       |
|Moderna     |Cox model                                    |

## What is the most relevant endpoint?

__SARS-CoV-2 infection__
* .blue2[+] relevant to stemming spread, many infections will be observed
* .red[-] clinically relevant? measured coarsely in time; many false positives

__COVID__
* .blue2[+] more clinically relevant, reasonable number of cases expected
* .red[-] clinically relevant if symptoms are mild?

__Severe COVID__
* .blue2[+] most clinically relevant, a-priori highest expected efficacy
* .red[-] very few cases expected to be observed, longer evaluation needed

---

## What is the most relevant endpoint?

__Burden of disease (BOD)__
* .blue2[+] more clinically relevant than COVID
* .blue2[+] lower power for .red[vaccines of questionable benefit]
* .blue2[+] power at least as high as COVID for .blue1[likely vaccine profiles]
* .red[-] best way to assign burden score? treating ordinal as continuous ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

## What is the most relevant endpoint?

[FDA guidance](https://www.fda.gov/media/139638/download) (pg. 13) states __either COVID or SARS-CoV-2 infection__ is an acceptable primary endpoint.
  *  OWS guidance to companies has been that __infection alone__ is __not acceptable__ as primary endpoint. 

<br> 

FDA guidance states companies, "should consider __powering efficacy trials__ for formal hypothesis testing on a __severe COVID endpoint__ [or] evaluate as a __secondary endpoint__."
  * Only Janssen so far is powering for severe COVID as primary.

## How is $\text{VE}$ being monitored?

|__Company__ | __Endpoints__ | $\alpha$__-adj.__* | __Success__ |
|:-----------|:--------------------------------------------|
|Pfizer      | 32, 62, 92, 120, 164 | PCK | $P(\text{VE} > 30 \mid \text{data}) > 0.995/0.986$ |
|Moderna     |35, 106, 151 | OBF | Reject $H_0: \text{VE} <30$   |
|AZ          |75, 150 | OBF | Reject $H_0: \text{VE} <30$ |
|Janssen     |20 + weekly | PCK | Reject $H_0: \text{VE} <30$ |
\* .small[alpha-spending function: OBF = O'Brien Fleming-like; PCK = Pocock-like]

In response to __criticism about stopping too early__, I .red[think] that prior to an EUA, companies now must have:

* 50% of participants complete two months of follow-up;
* at least 6 COVID cases in $\ge$ 60 age group; and
* at least 5 cases of severe COVID.


---

## How is $\text{VE}$ being monitored?

* OBF = very conservative early, saves $\alpha$ for final
* PCK = more aggressive early, less $\alpha$ left for final

## What if efficacy declared early?

Reasons to __feel good__: 

* vaccine available sooner, at least for most vulnerable
* based on the data, there's a good chance vaccine works well

Posterior based on 32 cases (26:6 placebo:vax) and a very skeptical prior.

This prior puts 50% of its mass on 0; the rest spread across positive VE.

---

## What if efficacy declared early?

Reasons to __feel bad__:

* if blinded follow-up stops
  * no way to assess durability
  * underpowered to assess VE in subgroups 
  * underpowered to assess VE against severe COVID
* if active-control/non-inferiority trials become necessary
  * huge sample sizes required
* if political pressure played a role in granting an EUA

<br> 

Personally, I believe the .red[the worst outcome] is an __only-moderately-effective vaccine__ being granted an EUA and blinded follow-up being discontinued.

## Correlates of protection

If an CoP is established to __reliably predict vaccine efficacy__, then subsequent efficacy trials may use the CoP as the __primary endpoint__. 

Accelerates approval for: 

* different populations (e.g., children, pregnant women);
* new vaccines in the same class in same/different populations.

<br> 

In effect: 

.center[.large[__A CoP is a candidate surrogate endpoint.__]]

## Measuring correlates

Running assays on >30,000 blood draws is timely, expensive, and, as it turns out, statistically unnecessary.

Instead we measure immune responses in:

* a stratified random subcohort (\~1600 individuals)
* all SARS-CoV-2 and COVID endpoints

This is a __case-cohort design__ ([Prentice, 1986](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2336266?seq=1)), a special case of a __two-phase sampling design__ ([Breslow, 2009](https://academic.oup.com/aje/article/169/11/1398/159218)).

* Phase 1: measure baseline variables, vaccine, endpoint __on everyone__
* Phase 2: given baseline, vaccine, endpoint, select members of __immune response subcohort__ with (known) probability

---

## Estimation in two-phase designs

.pull-left[
* $W$ = baseline covariates
* $A$ = vaccine assignment
* $Y$ = COVID endpoint
]

.pull-right[
* $\Delta$ = indicator of being in immune response subcohort
* $\Delta S$ = measure of immune responses $S$
]

Suppose we are interested in $E(S)$. Use __Horvitz-Thompson/IPTW estimator__: $$
\hat{\mu} = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n \frac{\Delta_i}{P(\Delta = 1 \mid W_i, A_i, Y_i)} S_i \ . 
$$

More efficient to use __augmented estimator__: 
$$
\hat{\mu} + \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n \left(1 - \frac{\Delta_i}{P(\Delta = 1 \mid W_i, A_i, Y_i)} \right) \hat{E}(S \mid \Delta = 1, A_i, W_i, Y_i) \ . 
$$

???

Intuition: if $Y$ or $W$ is perfectly predictive of $S$, then $\hat{E}(S \mid \Delta = 1, A_i, W_i, Y_i)$ is like imputing the true value. So it's like we measured $S$ on more people!

It turns out that consistency of $\hat{\mu}$ is not impacted by model for $S$ -- double robustness.

---

## Estimation in two-phase designs

This augmented approach generalizes to a whole class of parameters ([Rose and van der Laan, 2011](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3083136/)). For example, in [Hejazi et al, 2020](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/biom.13375?af=R) we study $$
\psi_{\delta} = \iint P(Y = 1 \mid A = 1, w, s + \delta) \ f_S(s \mid A = 1, w) \ f_W(w) \ ds \ dw \ . 
$$

Under assumptions, $\psi_{\delta}$ = counterfactual risk of COVID if given vaccine AND a $\delta$ unit increase to immune response $S$.

* can summarize trend using projection onto working model

## Current status

The goal is to have correlates analysis as soon as possible after efficacy is declared for a Phase III trial. 

<br> 

CoVPN stat group is preparing a __unified correlates analysis plan__. 

* will be publicly available for comment soon
* reproducible, automated reports

<br> 

Where possible, we try to make use of __targeted learning approaches__.

* flexible, pre-specified regression using super learner
* combined with efficient, robust estimators

---

## Conclusions

From where I sit, the __science__ behind the development and evaluation of preventive COVID-19 vaccines __is rigorous__. 
* Chest-thumping from politicians and CEOs aside...

<br> 

The __increased transparency__ via releasing of the protocols is a __good thing__ for scientists and consumers. 

<br> 

There are __challenging decisions__ that need to be made in the design of these trials. There are __no right answers__. 
* Academics should take care to acknowledge this in public discourse.
