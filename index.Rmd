## What is primary hypothesis test?

Vaccine efficacy, $\text{VE}$, is the __percent reduction in relative risk__ comparing vaccine to placebo. 

$$
\text{VE} = 1 - \frac{\text{‚Äúrisk‚Äù in vaccine}}{\text{‚Äúrisk‚Äù in placebo}}
$$

* $\text{‚Äúrisk‚Äù}$ of what? See next slides.
* $\text{‚Äúrisk‚Äù}$ quantified by hazard, cumulative incidence, incidence rate, ...
  * in rare event setting, all similar

[FDA guidance](https://www.fda.gov/media/139638/download) (pg. 14) stipulates: 
* a point estimate of $\text{VE}$ for the primary endpoint of at
least 50% __and__ 
* lower bound of an appropriately adjusted confidence interval >30%.
* overall type I error control for one-sided test at 2.5%. 

---

## How is $\text{VE}$ estimated/tested?

|__Company__ | __Estimation approach__                     |
|:-----------|:--------------------------------------------|
|Pfizer      |Bayesian beta-binomial                       |
|Moderna     |Cox model                                    |
|AZ          |Poisson regression model                     |
|Janssen     |Binomial + sequential probability ratio test |

Simulation studies showed __little difference in power__ across approaches.

## What is the most relevant endpoint?

__SARS-CoV-2 infection__
* .blue2[+] relevant to stemming spread, many infections will be observed
* .red[-] clinically relevant? measured coarsely in time; many false positives

__COVID__
* .blue2[+] more clinically relevant, reasonable number of cases expected
* .red[-] clinically relevant if symptoms are mild?

__Severe COVID__
* .blue2[+] most clinically relevant, a-priori highest expected efficacy
* .red[-] very few cases expected to be observed, longer evaluation needed

---

## What is the most relevant endpoint?

__Burden of disease (BOD)__
* .blue2[+] more clinically relevant than COVID
* .blue2[+] lower power for .red[vaccines of questionable benefit]
* .blue2[+] power at least as high as COVID for .blue1[likely vaccine profiles]
* .red[-] best way to assign burden score? treating ordinal as continuous ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

## What is the most relevant endpoint?

[FDA guidance](https://www.fda.gov/media/139638/download) (pg. 13) states __either COVID or SARS-CoV-2 infection__ is an acceptable primary endpoint.
  *  OWS guidance to companies has been that __infection alone__ is __not acceptable__ as primary endpoint. 

<br> 

FDA guidance states companies, "should consider __powering efficacy trials__ for formal hypothesis testing on a __severe COVID endpoint__ [or] evaluate as a __secondary endpoint__."
  * Only Janssen so far is powering for severe COVID as primary.

## Correlates of protection

If an CoP is established to __reliably predict vaccine efficacy__, then subsequent efficacy trials may use the CoP as the __primary endpoint__. 

Accelerates approval for: 

* different populations (e.g., children, pregnant women);
* new vaccines in the same class in same/different populations.

In effect: 

.center[.large[__A CoP is a candidate surrogate endpoint.__]]

## Measuring correlates

Running assays on >30k samples is .red[expensive] and __statistically unnecessary__.

Instead we __measure immune responses__ in:

* a stratified random subcohort (\~1600 individuals)
* all SARS-CoV-2 and COVID endpoints

This is a __case-cohort design__ ([Prentice, 1986](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2336266?seq=1)), a special case of a __two-phase sampling design__ ([Breslow, 2009](https://academic.oup.com/aje/article/169/11/1398/159218)).

* Phase 1: measure baseline variables, vaccine, endpoint __on everyone__
* Phase 2: given baseline, vaccine, endpoint, select members of __immune response subcohort__ with some (known) probability

## Estimation in two-phase designs

.pull-left[
* $W$ = baseline covariates
* $A$ = vaccine assignment
* $Y$ = COVID endpoint
]

.pull-right[
* $\Delta$ = indicator of being in immune response subcohort
* $\Delta S$ = measure of immune responses $S$
]

Suppose we are interested in $E(S)$. Use __Horvitz-Thompson/IPTW estimator__: $$
\hat{\mu} = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n \frac{\Delta_i}{P(\Delta = 1 \mid W_i, A_i, Y_i)} S_i \ . 
$$

More efficient to use __augmented estimator__: 
$$
\hat{\mu} + \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n \left(1 - \frac{\Delta_i}{P(\Delta = 1 \mid W_i, A_i, Y_i)} \right) \hat{E}(S \mid \Delta = 1, A_i, W_i, Y_i) \ . 
$$

???

Intuition: if $Y$ or $W$ is perfectly predictive of $S$, then $\hat{E}(S \mid \Delta = 1, A_i, W_i, Y_i)$ is like imputing the true value. So it's like we measured $S$ on more people!

It turns out that consistency of $\hat{\mu}$ is not impacted by model for $S$ -- double robustness.

---

## Estimation in two-phase designs

This augmented approach [generalizes](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3083136/). In [Hejazi et al, 2020](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/biom.13375?af=R) we study $$
\psi_{\delta} = E[P(Y = 1 \mid A = 1, W, S = S + \delta)] \ .
$$

With assumptions, $\psi_{\delta}$ = __counterfactual risk__ with vaccine AND $\delta$ change in $S$.

Challenges for correlates in face of highly effective vaccines
* low case numbers, stability of estimators?

Establishment of correlate will have to draw from NHP studies, natural infection data, other sources.

Topics for discussion/open questions:
* Durability -- will we be able to continue blinded, placebo-controlled follow-up
  * I'm basically hearing the answer is "No!"
* Long term safety -- people still seem skeptical of mRNA vaccines wrt long term outcomes
* Bridging to children
* Importance of VE against infection
